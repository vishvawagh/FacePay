            <div class="section">
                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are a dedicated team of innovators committed to making financial technology accessible to all,
                    particularly to underserved and underprivileged communities. Our mission is to develop solutions
                    that make digital transactions secure, easy, and inclusive, especially for those who face challenges
                    in accessing traditional banking services.</p>

            <!-- Vision Section -->
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Our Vision:</h3>
                <p>We envision a future where digital payments are within everyone's reach, regardless of their
                    location, economic status, or technical knowledge. By leveraging advanced technologies like facial
                    recognition, voice commands, and regional language support, we aim to simplify transactions and make
                    digital payments a part of everyday life for everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Approach Section -->
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Our Approach:</h3>
                <p>Understanding the unique needs of underprivileged communities drives our approach. We have designed a
                    web application that allows shopkeepers to authenticate themselves using normal face recognition and
                    facilitates customer transactions through smile face authentication. For added convenience,
                    customers can check their balance using normal face scanning directly from the homepage.</p>
                <p>To ensure accessibility, our platform includes a toggle button on every page that allows users to
                    switch the interface language, currently offering Marathi. This ensures that users can navigate the
                    system with ease, in a language they understand.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Key Features and Workflow:</h3>
                <h4>Shopkeeper Registration and Login:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Registration Process:</strong> Shopkeepers begin by accessing the sign-up page, where
                        they provide their name, mobile number, and upload a photo. After successful registration, the
                        shopkeeper can log in to the system using facial recognition. If the camera fails to capture a
                        clear image, a PIN-based authentication is provided as a backup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice Command Functionality:</strong> Recognizing that many users in rural areas may
                        struggle with typing or navigating digital interfaces, our system offers voice command
                        interactions. Shopkeepers can provide required information through voice input, making the
                        process more accessible.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Home Page Interaction Section -->
            <div class="section">
                <h4>Home Page and Customer Interaction:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shopkeeper Dashboard:</strong> After logging in, the shopkeeper is directed to their
                        home page, which displays their profile details, including balance and transaction history. The
                        dashboard also includes an option for Customer Sign-Up, where customers can register by
                        providing their name, mobile number, and photo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Transaction Process:</strong> For transactions, the customerâ€™s number is
                        entered, followed by a smiling face scan to authorize the payment. The system ensures that
                        transactions are only successful after this dual-layer authentication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance Check:</strong> Customers can also check their balance on the homepage using
                        normal face authentication, making it easy for them to manage their funds and also check the
                        history.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- User Interface and Accessibility Section -->
            <div class="section">
                <h4>User Interface and Accessibility:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regional Language Support:</strong> A toggle button is provided on every page to switch
                        the interface language to Marathi, catering to users who are more comfortable with regional
                        languages.</li>
                    <li><strong>User-Friendly Design:</strong> The application is designed with simple icons and an
                        intuitive layout, ensuring that it is easy to navigate for users with varying levels of digital
                        literacy.</li>
